<h1>
  Like, Python<span class="subtitle"><em>(alpha)</em></span>
</h1>

<p>
  Like making computers do your bidding?<br/>
  Enjoy Python features like lambdas? Indent-grouping? List comprehensions?<br/>
  Tired of <strong>Old Man Python</strong> telling you what you can and can't say to <strong>your</strong> computer?<br/>
</p>
<p>
 It's about time programming languages understood what the kids are typing
 these days. So let's start with a baby step in that direction:
 <em>Like, Python</em>. 
</p>
<p>
  <em>Like, Python</em> was created by Jonathan Howard in February 2010 while
  drinking and reviewing code for an upcoming project with a coworker. 
  At a certain point, higher-level explanations devolved into just flat-out
  reading Python code like they were actually speaking the language normally -
  complete with like's, um's, whatever's, etc - making it completely
  <span style="text-decoration: line-through">impractical</span>
  awesome for work. It was then that Jonathan realized he should perhaps
  stop for the night. And START creating <em>Like, Python</em>.
</p>

<h2>
  EXAMPLE
</h2>
<p>
  <em>Like, Python</em> uses Python's own tokenizer to essentially add
  keywords to Python's lexical understanding.
  Python is a subset of <em>Like, Python</em>, so any script you've already
  written in Python is valid <em>Like, Python</em> and will run in the 
  interpreter.
  But you can also write like you'd speak. For example, the following is a
  fully-functional "hello world" script, included in the download as 
  hello_world.lp:
</p>
<pre>
  #!usr/bin/python
  # My first Like, Python script!

  yo just print like "hello world" bro
</pre>
<p>
  Here's a version that asks you for your name, then says hi.
  (Note that 'yo' is a <em>Like, Python</em> keyword but the interpreter
  actually understands real Python syntax, so the 'yo' in the input string
  works just fine.
</p>
<pre>
  #!usr/bin/python
  uh from sys import exit

  # Grab the user's name. 
  ok so like name = raw_input("yo! what's your name?" ) right
  
  # Make sure they entered something, then say hi.
  if name.strip() is actually like "":
      toootally just exit()
  else:
      um yeah
      print like "Hi %s, nice to meet you." % name
</pre>

<p>
A full list of <em>Like, Python</em> keywords is below (swearing optional):
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Valleygirl:	omg, so, like, totally, right, toootally
  </li>
  <li>
    Frat guy:	friggin, fuckin, dude, man, bro, broheim, broseph
  </li>
  <li>
    Internets:	lol, rofl, teh, ohai, plz
  </li>
  <li>
    Snoop:	yo, homey, homeboy, sup, dog, shit, girl, ma, biatch, ho, shiiit
  </li>
  <li>
    Local:	wicked, hella, anyways 
  </li>
  <li>
    Misc: 	just, hey, yeah, ok, um, uh, ah, actually, something
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
  INSTALLATION
</h2>
<p>
  To install on Mac OSX and Linux, just unzip, make sure you have admin
  privileges on your machine and, type the following from inside your
  likepython directory:
</p>
<pre>
  ~/downloads/likepython> sudo cp ./likepython /usr/bin/
  ~/downloads/likepython> sudo chmod 555 /usr/bin/likepython
</pre>
<p>
  If everything went well, you can now code in <em>Like, Python</em>!
  Test it on hello_world.lp (included) like so:
</p>
<pre>
  ~/downloads/likepython> likepython hello_world.lp
</pre>

<h2>
VERSION
</h2>
<p>
  This is version 0.1, the stable alpha release.
  If you like it, let me know! 
  jon<span style="display:none">athan</span>[at]staringispolite.com
</p>
<p>
  Or, you know, if not, you can like, tell me what you think
  could be improved. Especially new words Like, Python should include.
  Bro - it could like totally be in the next release.
